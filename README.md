# pentesting-api
A penetration testing library.

***Disclaimer:** The software contained in this repository, in no way, is meant to be used in any way that can be deemed as malicious or unlawful.  The author and owner of this repository is in no way responsible for any such activity.*

This library currently has the ability to execute commands and code remotely.  Therefore it has RCE (remote code/command execution) capabilities.  This is important because it allows the *pentester* the ability to execute commands on the system and let's them execute custom `C#` code.  For example, one could use `C#` code to encrypt all the files on a user's machine.

## Pentesting API

The API acts as an intermediary from the **Pentesting App** to the **Pentesting Client**.

### Features

1. Execute shell commands on the server.
2. Execute shell commands on the client.
3. Execute `C#` code on the client.

## Pentesting App

This is `React` app that connects to the **Pentesting API** and allows the user to send input and recieve output from the **Pentesting Client**.

*Still needed: a way to scan ports and execute commands on the server.*

## Pentesting Client

This is a simple `C#` program that allows commands and `C#` code to be exectued on it.  The commands and code is recieved from the **Pentesting API**.
